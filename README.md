Unofficial ChatGPT in Facebook Messenger made using [ChatGPT Unofficial API](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) in Node.js.
<br><br>
- Implemented some bot interactions such as marking messages as seen and typing indicators.
<br><br>
- Implemented conversation tracking so that the bot can remember the conversation.
<br><br>
*Note: This feature is limited since the server where the bot is hosted turns off the app whenever it is idle (no API requests).<br>
So whenever the app restarts, the conversation resets.*
