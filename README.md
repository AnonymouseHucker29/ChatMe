***<div align="center">ChatGPT but as a Facebook Messenger bot.</div>***

---

Unofficial ChatGPT in Facebook Messenger in Node.js made using [ChatGPT Unofficial API](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api).
<br><br>
- Implemented some bot interactions such as marking messages as seen and typing indicators.
<br><br>
- Implemented conversation tracking so that the bot can remember the conversation.
<br><br>
*Note: This feature is limited since the server where the bot is hosted turns off the app whenever it is idle (no API requests).<br>
So whenever the app restarts, the conversation resets.*
